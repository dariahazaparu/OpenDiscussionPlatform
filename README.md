# OpenDiscussionPlatform

#### FMI, UniBuc

Open Discussion Platform is a forum for foodies and people looking for delicious recipes from around the world. <br>
The official name is "**Gourmet World Tour**" and the project is still under development. The current stage is the final form for the project presentation. <br>
To use this website, download the code and put these files (https://tinyurl.com/opendiscussionappdata) into **APP DATA** folder and click RUN. <br>


As an unregistered user, you can see and travel around the globe and search for your favorite recipes. There are also comments from accredited *chefs*. <br> 
In order to become a chef, you need to register and simply start posting all traditional recipes you know and comment on those you tried already.<br>


There are 3 roles on this site: the **user**, the **moderator** and the **admin**. <br>
We already talked about the user and what he can do. <br>
The moderator is there to make sure the recipes and comments don't cross lines as in language and other bounderies.<br>
The admin is there to add more countries if needed and edit the photos for them. He also can **change** someboody's role, for example, a user can become admin and so on.<br>


Now, everyone has a **profile**. You can edit the details about youself so people can trust you more. You can add a profile picture yet. :( On this page, everybody can see your posts (recipes) and leave you comments. <br>


There is one button left, the one for searching through recipes using *keywords*. You can also sort them by posting date or alphabeticaly.<br>


***Remember***, this project is still under development so it is not finished. There are still more things to do as I have so many ideas, but it will take time.
